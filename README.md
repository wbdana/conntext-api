Connected Text (ConnText) is a work-in-progress text editor for programmers.

Planned features:

1. Pull files from GitHub repos;
2. Save/load files from ConnText API;
3. Grant other ConnText users access to a file;
4. Facilitate multi-user live text editing (think Google Docs) through Rails Action Cable in the back end.

Stretch goals that may or may not be implemented at a later date:

1. Full GitHub integration, including login/signup and ability to open full repos;
2. Ability to have multiple files open at once in tabs;
3. Ability to create and push commits to GitHub directly from ConnText.
